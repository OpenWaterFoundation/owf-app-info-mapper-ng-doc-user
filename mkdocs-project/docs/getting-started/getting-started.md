## Introduction ##

Currently, the InfoMapper can only be installed by cloning the source repository.
An installer will be provided in the future.

Current development efforts by the Open Water Foundation are focusing
on the product design and staff requirements.
Although input from third parties is welcome, at this time,
priorities are focused on implementing features for OWF projects.

See other sections of this documentation for information about installing and configuring the InfoMapper.
