## Introduction ##

The InfoMapper software is a web application that displays text content pages,
maps, data visualizations, and other content.
It is being developed by the Open Water Foundation as a tool that can be
efficiently implemented to publish information products
generated by analysis software.

The InfoMapper is particularly useful when it is desired to fully automate the process of
creating information products and publishing to cloud web service storage solution and
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

The InfoMapper software is typically used in parallel with one or more workflow projects that
automates information product generation.
The [OWF GeoProcessor](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/latest/doc-user/)
software has features to create map configuration files
that can be used by the InfoMapper.

Currently, InfoMapper "users" are often software developers.
This documentation focuses on developers who are focusing on information product generation,
rather than software developers.
See the InfoMapper Developer Documentation for software development information.
